# Modelling Project Draft Submission

This folder contains our draft submission, to take note of our progress throughout the semester. Here, you can find the following:

* `project_draft.j`: A series of Jape proof ideas that we may or may not use in our final submission.
* `project_d4.j`: Some Jape proof ideas to help contextualize predicate logic for our potential first-order extension.
* `modelling_report_draft.pdf`: Documentation to aid in a more visual and neat understanding of our project.
